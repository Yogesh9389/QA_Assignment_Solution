// •	Verify that the calculator can handle operations involving both positive and negative numbers.
// •	Verify that the calculator correctly follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
// •	Check that the calculator handles decimal numbers correctly in all operations.

// 2. Edge Cases:
// •	Verify the behavior of the calculator when dividing by zero.
// •	Verify how the calculator handles very large or very small numbers.
// •	Check the calculator's response to operations involving non-numeric inputs.

// 3. User Interface:
// •	Verify that all buttons are properly labeled and function as intended.
// •	Verify that the display shows the correct result after performing an operation.
// •	Check that the calculator’s memory function works correctly (e.g., storing and recalling numbers).
// •	Verify that the clear (C) and all-clear (AC) buttons function correctly.

// 4. Performance:
// •	Verify that the calculator processes calculations instantly or within an acceptable time frame.
// •	Check the calculator's behavior when performing multiple operations quickly in succession.

// 5. Ergonomics and Usability:
// •	Verify that the buttons are easy to press and respond correctly.
// •	Verify that the calculator is easy to use and understand for both basic and advanced users.

// 6. Battery and Power Management
// •	Verify that the calculator works properly with low battery.
// •	Check that the calculator powers off after a period of inactivity to save battery life.

// 2.	Scenarios for Watch

// 1. Time Display:
// •	Verify that the watch displays the correct current time.
// •	Verify that the watch can switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
// •	Check that the watch correctly adjusts for daylight saving time.

// 2. Date and Alarm Functions:
// •	Verify that the watch displays the correct date.
// •	Verify that the alarm function can be set and goes off at the correct time.
// •	Check that the alarm can be easily snoozed or turned off.
// •	Verify that the watch handles leap years correctly.

// 3. Stopwatch and Timer:
// •	Verify that the stopwatch starts, stops, and resets correctly.
// •	Verify that the timer can be set and counts down correctly, with an alert when the time is up.

// 4. Battery Life
// •	Verify that the watch's battery life meets the specified duration.
// •	Check that the watch provides a low battery warning before it dies.
// •	Verify that the watch charges correctly if it is a rechargeable model.

// 5. Durability:
// •	Verify that the watch is water-resistant or waterproof as specified.
// •	Check that the watch face is resistant to scratches and impacts.
// •	Verify that the strap is durable and does not easily break.

// 6. User Interface and Usability:
// •	Verify that the buttons are easy to press and perform the expected functions.
// •	Verify that the watch is easy to set up and adjust, including time, date, and alarms.

// 3.	Scenarios for Sign-Up Page (Gmail or Flipkart)

// 1. Form Fields:
// •	Verify that all required fields (e.g., name, email, password) are present on the sign-up page.
// •	Verify that optional fields are clearly indicated as optional.
// •	Check that the form prevents submission if required fields are left blank.
// •	Verify that the password field hides the input for privacy.

// 2. Validation:
// •	Verify that the email field only accepts valid email formats (e.g., name@example.com).
// •	Verify that the password field enforces password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
// •	Check that the form displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
// •	Verify that the form validates if the email or username is already taken.

// 3. User Experience:
// •	Verify that the form is easy to navigate and use on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
// •	Check that the sign-up button is enabled only after all required fields are correctly filled out.
// •	Verify that the "show password" option works as intended without compromising security.

// 4. Security:
// •	Verify that passwords are encrypted before being sent to the server.
// •	Check that the form is protected against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
// •	Verify that CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms are in place to prevent automated sign-ups.

// 5. Confirmation and Errors:
// •	Verify that a confirmation message is shown after successful sign-up.
// •	Check that a verification email or SMS is sent if required (e.g., for email/phone verification).
// •	Verify that users are redirected to the appropriate page after signing up (e.g., inbox, dashboard).

// 6. Accessibility:
// •	Verify that the form is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
// •	Check that the form can be filled out using only the keyboard.
// •	Verify that color contrast and font sizes are adequate for users with visual impairments.

// 7. Performance:
// •	Verify that the form loads quickly and submits within an acceptable time frame.
// •	Check that the form handles high traffic without performance degradation.
